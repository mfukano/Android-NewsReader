This app was made for CMPS 121: Mobile App Development at the University of California, Santa Cruz. This is a simple app that allows you to choose between three popular news stations in the San Francisco Bay Area and opens them up in full resolution within a webview. The buttons were my first introduction to material design, including the share button on the webview, which allows the user to share the URL of the current page with any relevant application on their device.
